# Activist Toolkit
What your project is/does: It's a website to raise awareness about poverty for the GWC Activist project. It has a fact generator, email generator, and it's responsive. 
Why you made your project: I made this project to raise awareness about poverty. This is important because the first goal in the UN SDG is to eradicate poverty by 2030, which is coming closer. 
How you made your project: I made this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
What you struggled with and what you learned: I struggled with the fact generator but it was apparently due to a small , in the JS file which was annoying. I also struggled with coming up with the color scheme. Overall, the process was smooth, though, and I learned how to use JavaScript, since it was my first time using it. I am working on more complicated projects and hope to ship them soon as well.
