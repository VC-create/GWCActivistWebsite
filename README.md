# Activist Toolkit
This is a website to raise awareness about global poverty for the GWC Activist Website. It was my first time using JavaScript, and the website is responsive, has a fact generator, and a email generator. This is also a topic close to me because I come from India which has one of the highest poverty rates in the world, and I saw it firsthand :( which was really sad to see. The first goal on the UN SDG is to eradicate poverty by 2030, which at the rate the world is progressing, is not going to happen, which is why it is important to raise awareness. Also, you can learn more about specifically US programs like SNAP and CHIP which, due to budget cuts, are limiting access to low income families for food and health coverage, which could create a rise in poverty in the US. I made it using HTML, CSS, and JS. Overall I feel that I progressed much faster through this website than my first one (spent half the time!), and I feel like I understood a lot more of what I was doing. I also enjoyed using Javascript. After this project, I'm working on some bigger projects which I want to submit after and hopefully show more technical growth. Sorry if this is way too long!
