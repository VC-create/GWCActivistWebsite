      <h1>Every human being deserves the right to live in dignity and afford a good quality of life.</h1>
      <!--My name is [Your Name], and I live in [Your City or District]. I’m writing to share concerns on cuts for two essential programs: SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program).

      SNAP helps families afford groceries and nutritional food. CHIP provides health coverage to millions of children. 

      I’m especially concerned about the cuts and different eligibility requierements that are now being imposed in order to have access to these programs. These programs need to be fully funded to protect millions of Americans. 

      I strongly hope that you will consider:

      Supporting increased funding for SNAP and CHIP

      Oppose any legislation that adds barriers to access, such as harsher work requirements or shortened eligibility periods.

      Champion policies that expand outreach and enrollment, especially in underserved communities.

      Thank you for your service and for considering the needs of working families, children, and the most vulnerable in our community. -->
