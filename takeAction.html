      <h1>Every human being deserves the right to live in dignity and afford a good quality of life.</h1>
      <p>In order to acheive this, you can support initiatives that help low income familes, who have a higher risk of expereincing poverty.</p>
      <p>Some initiatives that help support low income families are SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and  CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program). SNAP helps families afford nutritional food while CHIP provides health coverage. <b>However, these programs are now in danger due to cuts.</b> In fact, the cuts to SNAP will be the largest in the program's history, which will impact hundreds of Americans. Additonally, harsher requirements are being imposed to be eligible for these programs.</p>
