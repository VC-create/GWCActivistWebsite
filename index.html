    <main>
        <p>Poverty is when someone does not have the resources to meet the basic standards of living. They lack essentials and cannot fulfill basic needs like food, water, clothing, and more. </p>
      <p>Poverty is also linked to other problems like human rights, child labor, human trafficking, health risks, and instability. The first goal on the United Nations Sustainable Devlopment Goals is "End poverty in all forms everywhere". They want this goal acheived by 2030. <b>With the current progress of the world right now, this goal is not going to be achieved.</b>"</p>
